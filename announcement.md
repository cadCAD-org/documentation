## cadCAD will be releasing Production and Beta builds
cadCAD is moving towards a release model of Production and Beta builds of cadCAD, where Production represents the latest stable build and the Beta release candidate being tested prior to distribution as the new version of Production. Our aim is to introduce more stability for models already built in the cadCAD ecosystem as we introduce fixes and updates while simultaneously increasing the quality of each release with a wider scope and battery of testing with broad participation. As we mature towards this release process, we are first inviting users of the Labs Platform private Beta to participate on this first iteration.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT) of the Labs Platform private Beta will use the version of cadCAD in the dev branch, which represents the cadCAD Beta. Please contact Catoya to participate.

## cadCAD Beta
This version addresses of some of the open cadCAD GitHub issues that will be resolved in the next release.
