## cadCAD will be releasing Production and Beta builds
cadCAD is moving towards a release model of Production and Beta builds. Production represents the latest stable build and Beta is the release candidate undergoing testing. Our aim is to introduce more stability for models already built in the cadCAD ecosystem as we introduce fixes and updates. We also aim to increase the quality of each release with a wider scope of testing with broad participation. As we mature towards this release process, we are first inviting users of the Labs Platform Private Alpha to participate on this first iteration.

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) of the Labs Platform Private Alpha will use the version of cadCAD in the staging branch, which represents a provisional cadCAD Beta. Please contact Chris Frazier or Chris Catoya(@Drcatman) to participate.

## cadCAD Beta
This version addresses of some of the open cadCAD GitHub issues that will be resolved in the next release.
